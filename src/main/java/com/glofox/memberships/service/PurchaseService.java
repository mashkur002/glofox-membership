/**
 * Every membership business rule lives here.
 *
 * <p>Carries no {@code @Service} annotation. The rule for the whole codebase is
 * that {@code config/} and {@code web/} may import Spring and
 * {@code domain/ store/ storage/ service/} may not, which makes the layering
 * boundary a single greppable command instead of four with exceptions. The cost
 * is one small configuration class; the benefit is that this service is
 * constructible by hand, which is what every test here does.
 *
 * <h2>Why the ordering is reserve, then charge, then commit</h2>
 *
 * In-memory storage offers no transaction to roll back, so <em>ordering is</em>
 * the consistency story. Claims are taken before the charge because a claim is
 * cheap and reversible while a charge is neither. Charging first and then
 * discovering the pack is sold out would mean taking money for something that
 * cannot be delivered — that is a defect, not a trade-off.
 *
 * <p>Every claim pushes its own undo onto a stack. If anything later throws,
 * the stack unwinds in reverse and the original failure is rethrown.
