/**
 * The normalised identity a member is matched on.
 *
 * <p>Normalisation happens in the compact constructor, which reassigns the
 * parameter. That means <em>every</em> construction normalises and an
 * unnormalised {@code MemberKey} cannot exist anywhere in the system. A static
 * factory would have left {@code new MemberKey(raw)} reachable.
 *
 * <p>Trimming uses neither {@code trim()} nor {@code strip()}, because both are
 * insufficient and in different ways. {@code trim()} only removes characters at
 * or below {@code U+0020}. {@code strip()} removes anything
 * {@link Character#isWhitespace(char)} accepts, which is broader but still
 * excludes non-breaking spaces by design — Java treats {@code U+00A0} as
 * <em>not</em> whitespace because it is not a line-break opportunity. A member
 * name pasted from a web page frequently carries a trailing {@code U+00A0}, and
 * under {@code strip()} that name would be a <strong>different member</strong>,
 * making the one-active-unlimited rule bypassable with an invisible character.
 * So {@link #isSpace(char)} accepts either predicate.
 *
 * <p>This closes leading and trailing invisible space only. Interior spacing,
 * zero-width characters and homoglyph confusables ({@code "Аlice"} with a
 * Cyrillic А) are deliberately out of scope; full confusable folding needs a
 * real member registry rather than a name string, and is recorded as a known
 * gap.
 *
 * <p>{@code toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT)} rather than {@code toLowerCase()}: under a
 * Turkish default locale {@code "ALICE".toLowerCase()} yields {@code "alıce"}
 * with a dotless i, which would make {@code "ALICE"} and {@code "alice"}
 * different members. The one-unlimited-membership rule would then be bypassable
 * by server configuration rather than by anything in the request.
